## How to run

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/). Install Git-LFS using your method of choice first to make sure you clone all of the necessary files.
This project is built in Next.js. To run, first run `npm i` to install all dependencies and then `npm run dev` to start the local development server. There are currently
many issues, and **your IDE will likely scream at you about 100+ errors** (mainly related to garbage React code as well as TypeScript errors), but **they shouldn't stop the app from compiling.**
